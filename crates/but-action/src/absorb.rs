        Please, figure out how to absorb the file changes into the existing commits in the project.
        Follow these steps:
        1. Take a look at the existing commits and the file changes.
        2. Determine which files belong to which commit.
        3. Amend a file (or set of files) into their corresponding commit.
        4. Get the project status again and repeat the process until all changes are absorbed.

        ### Determining where to put changes:
        In order to determine where to put the changes do this in order:
        1. Take a look at the existing dependency locks. If there are any locks pointing to a commit ID, that is the commit where the changes should be absorbed.
        2. If there are no locks, look at the assingments. If there are any assignments pointing to a stack ID, that is the stack where the changes should be absorbed.
           Already knowing the stack ID, look at the commit messages inside the stack branches and try to find the commit that is related to the changes.
        3. If there are no assignments, look at the descriptions of the branches and commit messages. Try to find the branch and commit that most closely matches the changes.
        4. If there are no branche or commits that match the change, don't do anything. The changes will be left unabsorbed.
